# Validation Document Format

This document provides a template for creating a validation document, such as a test plan or a Design Change Notice (DCN).

## 1. Introduction

- **Purpose**: State the objective of the document (e.g., "This document describes the test plan for the FIFO project.").
- **Scope**: Define the features and components that are covered.

## 2. Design Overview

- **Functional Description**: Briefly describe the functionality of the DUT.
- **Interface Signals**: List and describe the input and output signals of the DUT.

## 3. Testbench Architecture

- **Block Diagram**: Provide a diagram of the UVM testbench architecture.
- **Component Descriptions**: Describe the role of each component (e.g., driver, monitor, scoreboard).

## 4. Test Plan

- **Testcases**: List the testcases to be implemented. For each testcase, include:
  - **Test Name**: A descriptive name for the test (e.g., `test_write_read`).
  - **Description**: A brief description of the test's objective.
  - **Stimulus**: The stimulus that will be applied to the DUT.
  - **Checks**: The checks that will be performed by the scoreboard.

### Example Testcase

- **Test Name**: `test_read_from_empty`
- **Description**: This test verifies that the FIFO correctly handles a read attempt when it is empty.
- **Stimulus**:
  1. Reset the DUT.
  2. Do not write any data to the FIFO.
  3. Attempt to read from the FIFO by asserting `r_en`.
- **Checks**:
  - Verify that the `empty` signal is asserted.
  - Verify that the data read from the FIFO is the default value (or 'X').

## 5. Coverage Plan

- **Functional Coverage**: Define the covergroups and coverpoints to measure functional coverage.
- **Code Coverage**: Specify the target code coverage metrics (e.g., line, toggle, FSM).

## 6. DCN (Design Change Notice)

When a bug is found and fixed, a DCN should be created to document the change.

- **Bug Description**: A detailed description of the bug, including the symptoms and the root cause.
- **Fix Description**: A description of the code changes made to fix the bug.
- **Verification**: A description of the verification steps taken to ensure that the fix is correct and does not introduce any new bugs. This should include the specific tests that were run.
