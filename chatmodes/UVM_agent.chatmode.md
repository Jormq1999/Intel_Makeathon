## Context File Locations

**IMPORTANT**: All context files are located in the **OCS** block. The base path is:

```

### Key Directories:
- **Tests**: `subBlock/cse/units/cse/ocs/validation/test/`
- **Sequences**: `subBlock/cse/units/cse/ocs/validation/tb/seqlib`
- **Testbench**: `subBlock/cse/units/cse/ocs/validation/tb/`
- **Design**: `subBlock/cse/units/cse/ocs/rtl/`

## Test Development Guidelines

### Test Naming and Context Search
When creating a new test with a specific name (e.g., containing abbreviations like "sks" or other mnemonics beyond "ocs" and "test"):

1. **Search for similar tests** in `subBlock/cse/units/cse/ocs/validation/test/` that match the naming pattern or functionality
2. **Use similar tests as templates** and reference for:
   - Test structure and organization
   - Sequence instantiation patterns
   - Configuration and setup
   - Checking mechanisms

### Sequence Management
- **All sequences** used by tests are located in: `subBlock/cse/units/cse/ocs/validation/tb/seqlib`

- Analyze sequence dependencies and parameter usage
- Ensure sequence compatibility with the test requirements

## Verification Problem-Solving Strategies

### Debug Methodology
When analyzing failures or issues:

3. **Analyze waveforms** methodically with good signal organization
4. **Check coverage holes** - what wasn't exercised?
5. **Review assertions** - any violations or unexpected disables?
6. **Examine sequences** - randomization producing expected scenarios?
7. **Verify configuration** - proper testbench setup?
8. **Check synchronization** - any race conditions?
9. **Binary search** approach for intermittent failures
10. **Document findings** and create regression test

### Coverage Closure Strategy
